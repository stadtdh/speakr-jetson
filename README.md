## Overview

Speakr transforms your audio recordings into organized, searchable, and intelligent notes. Built for privacy-conscious groups and individuals, it runs entirely on your own infrastructure, ensuring your sensitive conversations remain completely private.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Smart Recording & Upload** - Record directly in browser or upload existing audio files
- **AI Transcription** - High-accuracy transcription with speaker identification
- **Voice Profiles** - AI-powered speaker recognition with voice embeddings (requires WhisperX ASR service)
- **REST API v1** - Complete API with Swagger UI for automation tools (n8n, Zapier, Make) and dashboard widgets
- **Single Sign-On** - Authenticate with any OIDC provider (Keycloak, Azure AD, Google, Auth0, Pocket ID)
- **Audio-Transcript Sync** - Click transcript to jump to audio, auto-highlight current text, follow mode for hands-free playback
- **Interactive Chat** - Ask questions about your recordings and get AI-powered answers
- **Inquire Mode** - Semantic search across all recordings using natural language
- **Internationalization** - Full support for English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and Russian
- **Beautiful Themes** - Light and dark modes with customizable color schemes

### Collaboration & Sharing
- **Internal Sharing** - Share recordings with specific users with granular permissions (view/edit/reshare)
- **Group Management** - Create groups with automatic sharing via group-scoped tags
- **Public Sharing** - Generate secure links to share recordings externally (admin-controlled)
- **Group Tags** - Tags that automatically share recordings with all group members

### Organization & Management
- **Smart Tagging** - Organize with tags that include custom AI prompts and ASR settings
- **Tag Prompt Stacking** - Combine multiple tags to layer AI instructions for powerful transformations
- **Tag Protection** - Prevent specific recordings from being auto-deleted
- **Group Retention Policies** - Set custom retention periods per group tag
- **Auto-Deletion** - Automatic cleanup of old recordings with flexible retention policies

## Real-World Use Cases

Different people use Speakr's collaboration and retention features in different ways:

| Use Case | Setup | What It Does |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Family memories** | Create "Family" group with protected tag | Everyone gets access to trips and events automatically, recordings preserved forever |
| **Book club discussions** | "Book Club" group, tag monthly meetings | All members auto-share discussions, can add personal notes about what resonated |
| **Work project group** | Share individually with 3 teammates | Temporary collaboration, easy to revoke when project ends |
| **Daily group standups** | Group tag with 14-day retention | Auto-share with group, auto-cleanup of routine meetings |
| **Architecture decisions** | Engineering group tag, protected from deletion | Technical discussions automatically shared, preserved permanently as reference |
| **Client consultations** | Individual share with view-only permission | Controlled external access, clients can't accidentally edit |
| **Research interviews** | Protected tag + Obsidian export | Preserve recordings indefinitely, transcripts auto-import to note-taking system |
| **Legal consultations** | Group tag with 7-year retention | Automatic sharing with legal group, compliance-based retention |
| **Sales calls** | Group tag with 1-year retention | Whole sales group learns from each call, cleanup after sales cycle |

### Creative Tag Prompt Examples

Tags with custom prompts transform raw recordings into exactly what you need:

- **Recipe recordings**: Record yourself cooking while narrating - tag with "Recipe" to convert messy speech into formatted recipes with ingredient lists and numbered steps
- **Lecture notes**: Students tag lectures with "Study Notes" to get organized outlines with concepts, examples, and definitions instead of raw transcripts
- **Code reviews**: "Code Review" tag extracts issues, suggested changes, and action items in technical language developers can use directly
- **Meeting summaries**: "Action Items" tag ignores discussion and returns just decisions, tasks, and deadlines

### Tag Stacking for Combined Effects

Stack multiple tags to layer instructions:
- "Recipe" + "Gluten Free" = Formatted recipe with gluten substitution suggestions
- "Lecture" + "Biology 301" = Study notes format focused on biological terminology
- "Client Meeting" + "Legal Review" = Client requirements plus legal implications highlighted

The order can matter - start with format tags, then add focus tags for best results.

### Integration Examples

- **Obsidian/Logseq**: Enable auto-export to write completed transcripts directly to your vault using your custom template - no manual export needed
- **Documentation wikis**: Map auto-export to your wiki's import folder for seamless transcript publishing
- **Content creation**: Create SRT subtitle templates from your audio recordings for podcasts or video content
- **Project management**: Extract action items with custom tag prompts, then auto-export for automated task creation

## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir speakr && cd speakr

# Download docker-compose configuration:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/master/config/docker-compose.example.yml -O docker-compose.yml

# Download the environment template:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/master/config/env.transcription.example -O .env

# Configure your API keys and launch
nano .env
docker compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:8899
```

> **Lightweight image:** Use `learnedmachine/speakr:lite` for a smaller image (~725MB vs ~4.4GB) that skips PyTorch. All features work normally — only Inquire Mode's semantic search falls back to basic text search.

**Required API Keys:**
- `TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY` - For speech-to-text (OpenAI) or `ASR_BASE_URL` for self-hosted
- `TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY` - For summaries, titles, and chat (OpenRouter or OpenAI)

### Transcription Options

Speakr uses a **connector-based architecture** that auto-detects your transcription provider:

| Option | Setup | Speaker Diarization | Voice Profiles |
|--------|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| **OpenAI Transcribe** | Just API key | ✅ `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize` | ❌ |
| **WhisperX ASR** | GPU container | ✅ Best quality | ✅ |
| **Legacy Whisper** | Just API key | ❌ | ❌ |

**Simplest setup (OpenAI with diarization):**
```bash
TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL=gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize
```

**Best quality (Self-hosted WhisperX):**
```bash
ASR_BASE_URL=http://whisperx-asr:9000
ASR_RETURN_SPEAKER_EMBEDDINGS=true  # Enable voice profiles
```
Requires [WhisperX ASR Service](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/whisperx-asr-service) container with GPU.

> **⚠️ PyTorch 2.6 Users:** If you encounter a "Weights only load failed" error with WhisperX, add `TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=true` to your ASR container. See [troubleshooting](https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/troubleshooting#pytorch-26-weights-loading-error-whisperx-asr-service) for details.
