# Installation Guide

This comprehensive guide covers deploying Speakr for production use, including detailed configuration options, performance tuning, and deployment best practices. While the Quick Start guide gets you running quickly, this guide provides everything you need for a robust production deployment.

## Understanding Speakr's Architecture

Before diving into installation, it's helpful to understand how Speakr works. The application integrates with external APIs for two main purposes: transcription services that convert your audio to text, and text generation services that power features like summaries, titles, and interactive chat. Speakr is designed to be flexible, supporting both cloud-based services like OpenAI and self-hosted solutions running on your own infrastructure.

Speakr uses a **connector-based architecture** for transcription services, providing a unified interface regardless of which provider you choose. Three connectors are currently available:

1. **ASR Endpoint** (Recommended for best quality) - For self-hosted solutions like WhisperX that offer GPU-accelerated transcription with superior accuracy, voice profiles, and speaker diarization
2. **OpenAI Transcribe** - Uses `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize` for cloud-based speaker diarization without requiring additional containers
3. **OpenAI Whisper** - Legacy whisper-1 model for basic transcription using any legacy OpenAI compatible whisper API

The connector can be specified or inferred based on your configuration. For text generation, Speakr uses the OpenAI Chat Completions API format with the `/chat/completions` endpoint, which is widely supported across different AI providers.

## Prerequisites

For a production deployment, ensure your system meets these requirements. You'll need Docker Engine version 20.10 or later and Docker Compose version 2.0 or later. The system should have at least 4GB of RAM, with 8GB recommended for optimal performance, especially if you're processing longer recordings. Plan for at least 20GB of free disk space to accommodate recordings and transcriptions, though actual requirements will depend on your usage patterns. The server should have a stable internet connection for API calls to transcription and AI services, unless you're running everything locally.

## Choosing Your Deployment Method

You have two main options for deploying Speakr. The first and recommended approach is using the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub, which requires no source code and gets you running quickly. The second option is building from source, which is useful if you need to modify the code or prefer to build your own images. Both methods use Docker Compose for orchestration and management.

## Standard Installation Using Pre-Built Image

### Step 1: Create Installation Directory

Choose an appropriate location for your Speakr installation. This directory will contain your configuration files and data volumes. For production deployments, using a dedicated directory like `/opt/speakr` or `/srv/speakr` is recommended as it provides a clear separation from user home directories and follows Linux filesystem hierarchy standards.

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/speakr
cd /opt/speakr
```

If you're just testing or running Speakr for personal use, you can create the directory in your home folder instead. The location isn't critical, but keeping everything organized in one place makes management easier.

### Step 2: Create Docker Compose Configuration

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following configuration:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: learnedmachine/speakr:latest
    container_name: speakr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8899:8899"
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/data/uploads
      - ./instance:/data/instance
```

**Choosing an image tag:**

| Tag | Size | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `latest` | ~4.4GB | Full image with semantic search via PyTorch embeddings |
| `lite` | ~725MB | Lightweight image without PyTorch — all features work, Inquire Mode falls back to text search |

If you don't plan to use Inquire Mode's semantic search (or are fine with basic text search), the `lite` tag is recommended for faster pulls and less disk usage. Just replace `latest` with `lite` in the configuration above.

Or download the example configuration:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/master/config/docker-compose.example.yml -O docker-compose.yml
```

The restart policy `unless-stopped` ensures Speakr automatically starts after system reboots unless you've explicitly stopped it. The volumes mount local directories for persistent storage of uploads and database files.

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

The environment configuration is where you tell Speakr which AI services to use and how to connect to them. Download the appropriate environment template based on your transcription service choice. This template contains all the configuration variables with helpful comments explaining each setting.

#### For OpenAI with Speaker Diarization (Cloud-Based)

If you don't want to self-host a transcription service, the easiest way to get speaker diarization is using OpenAI's `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize` model. This requires only an OpenAI API key—no additional containers needed.

Download the unified transcription configuration template:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/master/config/env.transcription.example -O .env
```

Configure your transcription service with just two key settings:

```bash
TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL=gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize
```

The connector automatically detects that you want the OpenAI Transcribe connector based on the model name. Other available models:
- `gpt-4o-transcribe` - High quality without diarization
- `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` - Cost-effective option
- `whisper-1` - Legacy model (uses Whisper connector)

> **Note:** For longer files (over ~23 minutes) using `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`, speaker tracking across chunks supports up to 4 speakers. Recordings with more speakers may have inconsistent labels across sections.

Now configure the text generation model that powers summaries, titles, and chat features. OpenRouter is recommended here because it provides access to multiple AI models at competitive prices, but you can use any OpenAI-compatible service:

```bash
TEXT_MODEL_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here
TEXT_MODEL_NAME=openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

If you prefer to use OpenAI directly for text generation, simply change the base URL to `https://api.openai.com/v1` and use your OpenAI API key. You can also use local models through Ollama or LM Studio by pointing to `http://localhost:11434/v1` or similar.

> **Tip:** For advanced model configuration options—including GPT-5 support, separate chat model settings for different service tiers, and cost optimization strategies—see the [Model Configuration](../admin-guide/model-configuration.md) guide.

#### For Legacy OpenAI Whisper API

If you prefer the legacy Whisper API (without diarization), you can still use the legacy configuration:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/master/config/env.whisper.example -O .env
```

Configure the transcription service:

```bash
TRANSCRIPTION_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL=whisper-1
```

> **Note:** The `WHISPER_MODEL` variable is deprecated. Use `TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL` instead.

#### For Self-Hosted ASR Endpoint (Recommended for Best Quality)

For the best transcription and diarization quality, self-hosting an ASR service is recommended. Based on testing, the WhisperX ASR Service with the latest pyannote models provides significantly better transcription accuracy and speaker diarization than cloud-based alternatives, especially when using large models like `large-v3`. **This requires running an additional Docker container** alongside Speakr, but provides powerful features including voice profiles that remember speakers across recordings.

**ASR Service Options:**

1. **WhisperX ASR Service (Recommended)** - Best transcription quality with voice profile support
   - Repository: [murtaza-nasir/whisperx-asr-service](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/whisperx-asr-service)
   - Uses `pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1` model with exclusive diarization
   - **Superior transcription and diarization quality** with large models (large-v3, distil-large-v3)
   - Supports 256-dimensional speaker embeddings for voice profile identification
   - Better timestamp alignment between speakers and words
   - **Required for:** Voice profiles, automatic speaker recognition, speaker embeddings
   - **Environment file:** `config/env.whisperx.example`
   - **Required setting:** `ASR_RETURN_SPEAKER_EMBEDDINGS=true` to enable voice profile features

2. **OpenAI Whisper ASR Webservice** - For basic speaker diarization without voice profiles
   - Repository: [ahmetoner/whisper-asr-webservice](https://github.com/ahmetoner/whisper-asr-webservice)
   - Uses `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` model
   - Simpler setup, less resource intensive
   - **Supports:** Basic speaker identification (Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.)
   - **Does not support:** Voice profiles, speaker embeddings, automatic speaker recognition
   - **Environment file:** `config/env.asr.example`
   - **Note:** Do not set `ASR_RETURN_SPEAKER_EMBEDDINGS=true` with this service as it will cause errors

> **Important:** Before proceeding with this configuration, you'll need to set up one of the ASR service containers. See [Running ASR Service for Speaker Diarization](#running-asr-service-for-speaker-diarization) for complete instructions on deploying both containers together or separately.

Download the appropriate ASR configuration template:

```bash
# For WhisperX ASR Service (with voice profiles):
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/master/config/env.whisperx.example -O .env

# OR for basic ASR (without voice profiles):
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/master/config/env.asr.example -O .env
```

The ASR configuration tells Speakr where to find your ASR service. Simply set the base URL and Speakr will automatically detect ASR mode:

```bash
# For WhisperX ASR Service:
ASR_BASE_URL=http://whisperx-asr:9000

# OR for basic ASR Webservice:
ASR_BASE_URL=http://whisper-asr:9000
```

> **Note:** The `USE_ASR_ENDPOINT=true` setting is deprecated. Just setting `ASR_BASE_URL` automatically enables ASR mode.

The ASR_BASE_URL depends on your deployment architecture:
- **Same Docker Compose stack:** Use the service name (e.g., `http://whisperx-asr:9000` or `http://whisper-asr:9000`) - Docker's internal networking
- **Separate machine:** Use the full URL with IP address or domain name (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:9000`)

Speaker diarization is automatically enabled when using ASR endpoints. The system will identify different speakers in your recordings and label them as Speaker 1, Speaker 2, and so on. You can optionally override the default speaker detection settings by uncommenting and adjusting ASR_MIN_SPEAKERS and ASR_MAX_SPEAKERS in your environment file.

**Voice Profile Configuration:**

If you're using WhisperX ASR Service and want to enable voice profile features (automatic speaker recognition across recordings), add this to your `.env` file:

```bash
ASR_RETURN_SPEAKER_EMBEDDINGS=true
```

This setting is disabled by default because it's only supported by WhisperX. If you're using the basic OpenAI Whisper ASR Webservice, leave this setting disabled or omit it entirely to avoid errors.

### Step 4: Configure System Settings

One of Speakr's conveniences is automatic admin account creation. Instead of going through a registration process, you define the admin credentials in your environment file, and Speakr creates the account automatically on first startup. This ensures you can log in immediately without any additional setup steps:

```bash
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@your-domain.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here
```

Choose a strong password for this account as it has full system access, including the ability to manage users and view all recordings. The admin account is special and cannot be created through the regular registration process, only through these environment variables.

Next, configure how the application behaves. These settings control user access and system operation:

```bash
ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false
REGISTRATION_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=
TIMEZONE="America/New_York"
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
```

Setting `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` means only the admin can create new user accounts, which is recommended for private installations where you want to control access. If you're running Speakr for a group or family, this prevents random people from creating accounts. If you enable registration and want to restrict it to specific email domains (e.g., for corporate use), set `REGISTRATION_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` to a comma-separated list of domains like `company.com,subsidiary.org`. Leave it empty to allow all domains. The timezone setting affects how dates and times are displayed throughout the interface, so set it to your local timezone for convenience. The log level controls how much information Speakr writes to its logs. Use `INFO` during initial setup and testing to see what's happening, then switch to `ERROR` for production to reduce log volume and improve performance.

### Step 5: Configure Advanced Features

#### Large File Handling

Speakr automatically handles large audio files through intelligent chunking. The behavior depends on which transcription connector you're using:

**Connector-Aware Chunking:**

| Connector | Chunking Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **ASR Endpoint** | Handled internally by the ASR service—no app-level chunking needed |
| **OpenAI Transcribe** | Handled internally using `chunking_strategy=auto`—no app-level chunking needed |
| **OpenAI Whisper** | App-level chunking for files >25MB using your configured settings |

For the OpenAI Whisper connector, you can customize chunking behavior:

```bash
ENABLE_CHUNKING=true
CHUNK_LIMIT=20MB
CHUNK_OVERLAP_SECONDS=3
```

When chunking is enabled, Speakr automatically detects when a file exceeds the configured limit and splits it into smaller pieces. Each chunk is processed separately, and the transcriptions are seamlessly merged back together. The overlap setting ensures that no words are lost at chunk boundaries, which is especially important for continuous speech. The chunk limit can be specified as a file size like `20MB` or as a duration like `20m` for 20 minutes.

> **Note:** These chunking settings are ignored when using ASR Endpoint or OpenAI Transcribe connectors, as those services handle large files internally.

#### Audio Compression

Speakr can automatically compress lossless audio uploads to save storage space. This is particularly useful when users upload large WAV or AIFF files from professional recording equipment or phone apps that record in uncompressed formats.

```bash
AUDIO_COMPRESS_UPLOADS=true
AUDIO_CODEC=mp3
AUDIO_BITRATE=128k
```

When enabled (the default), lossless files are automatically converted on upload:

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `AUDIO_COMPRESS_UPLOADS` | `true`/`false` | Enable automatic compression (default: `true`) |
| `AUDIO_CODEC` | `mp3`, `flac`, `opus` | Target format (default: `mp3`) |
| `AUDIO_BITRATE` | e.g., `64k`, `128k`, `192k` | Bitrate for lossy codecs (default: `128k`) |

**Codec options:**

- **mp3** - Lossy compression, excellent compatibility, smallest files (~90% reduction from WAV)
- **flac** - Lossless compression, preserves full audio quality (~50-70% reduction from WAV)
- **opus** - Modern lossy codec, efficient compression, good for speech

Already-compressed formats (MP3, AAC, OGG, M4A, etc.) are never re-encoded to avoid quality degradation. Only truly lossless formats (WAV, AIFF) are compressed.

**Excluding unsupported codecs:**

Some transcription services don't support certain audio codecs. For example, vLLM-hosted Whisper instances may not support Opus. If you encounter "format not recognised" errors, you can exclude specific codecs from Speakr's supported list, forcing them to be converted before transcription:

```bash
# Exclude a single codec
AUDIO_UNSUPPORTED_CODECS=opus

# Exclude multiple codecs (comma-separated)
AUDIO_UNSUPPORTED_CODECS=opus,vorbis
```

Supported codecs by default: `pcm_s16le`, `pcm_s24le`, `pcm_f32le`, `mp3`, `flac`, `opus`, `vorbis`, `aac`. Any codec listed in `AUDIO_UNSUPPORTED_CODECS` will be automatically converted to your target format (set by `AUDIO_CODEC`) before being sent to the transcription service.

!!! tip "Storage Savings Example"
    A 500MB WAV recording compressed to MP3 at 128k becomes roughly 50MB - a 90% reduction. For lossless preservation, FLAC typically achieves 50-70% reduction while maintaining perfect audio quality.

#### Inquire Mode for Semantic Search

Inquire Mode transforms Speakr from a simple transcription tool into a knowledge base of all your recordings. When enabled, you can search across all your transcriptions using natural language questions:

```bash
ENABLE_INQUIRE_MODE=true
```

With Inquire Mode active, Speakr creates embeddings of your transcriptions that enable semantic search. This means you can ask questions like "When did we discuss the marketing budget?" and find relevant recordings even if those exact words weren't used. The feature requires additional processing during transcription but provides powerful search capabilities that become more valuable as your recording library grows.

#### Automated File Processing

The automated file processing feature, sometimes called the "black hole" directory, monitors a designated folder for new audio files and automatically processes them without manual intervention. This is perfect for integrating with recording devices, automated workflows, or batch processing scenarios:

```bash
ENABLE_AUTO_PROCESSING=true
AUTO_PROCESS_MODE=admin_only
AUTO_PROCESS_WATCH_DIR=/data/auto-process
AUTO_PROCESS_CHECK_INTERVAL=30
```

When enabled, Speakr checks the watch directory every 30 seconds for new audio files. Any files found are automatically moved to the uploads directory and processed using your configured transcription settings. The `admin_only` mode assigns all processed files to the admin user, but you can also configure it for multi-user scenarios with separate directories for each user.

To use this feature, you'll need to mount an additional volume in your Docker Compose configuration, which we'll cover in the next steps.

### Step 6: Set Up Data Directories

Speakr needs local directories to store your data persistently. These directories are mounted as Docker volumes, ensuring your recordings and database survive container updates and restarts:

```bash
mkdir -p uploads instance
chmod 755 uploads instance
```

The `uploads` directory stores all your audio files and their transcriptions, organized by user. The `instance` directory contains the SQLite database that tracks all your recordings, users, and settings. Setting the permissions to 755 ensures the Docker container can read and write to these directories while maintaining reasonable security.

If you're using the automated file processing feature, create that directory as well:

```bash
mkdir -p auto-process
chmod 755 auto-process
```

#### Using PostgreSQL Instead of SQLite

By default, Speakr uses SQLite for its database, which is perfect for most installations and requires no additional setup.
However, if you need the scalability and concurrent access capabilities of PostgreSQL, Speakr fully supports it.

**Configuration:**

To use PostgreSQL, set the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/database_name
```

### Step 7: Launch Speakr

With everything configured, you're ready to start Speakr. The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode, meaning it continues running in the background:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The first time you run this command, Docker will download the Speakr image from Docker Hub. The `latest` image is approximately 4.4GB (or ~725MB for the `lite` tag) and contains all the dependencies needed to run Speakr, including FFmpeg for audio processing and various Python libraries. The download time depends on your internet connection speed.

Monitor the startup process to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
docker compose logs -f app
```

Watch the logs for any error messages. You should see messages about database initialization, admin user creation, and finally a message indicating the Flask application is running on port 8899. Press Ctrl+C to stop following the logs (this won't stop the container, just the log viewing).

### Step 8: Verify Installation

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://your-server:8899`, replacing `your-server` with your actual server address or `localhost` if you're running locally. You should see the Speakr login page with its distinctive gradient design.

Log in using the admin credentials you configured in the environment file. If login fails, check your Docker logs to ensure the admin user was created successfully. Sometimes typos in the environment file can cause issues.

Once logged in, test the installation by creating a test recording or uploading a sample audio file. The recording interface should show options for microphone, system audio, or both. Try uploading a small audio file first to verify that your API keys are working correctly. The transcription process should complete within a few moments for short files, and you should see the transcribed text appear along with an AI-generated summary.

If transcription fails, check the Docker logs for API authentication errors or connection issues. Common problems include incorrect API keys, insufficient API credits, or network connectivity issues.

## Advanced Deployment Scenarios

### Running ASR Service for Speaker Diarization

If you need speaker diarization to identify different speakers in your recordings, you'll need to run an ASR service alongside Speakr. There are two options depending on whether you need voice profile features:

#### Deploying ASR Service with Speakr

Once you've chosen and set up your ASR service, you can deploy it alongside Speakr in several ways:

**Same Machine - Combined Docker Compose (Recommended)**

Example with WhisperX ASR Service (for voice profiles):

```yaml
services:
  whisperx-asr:
    build:
      context: ./whisperx-asr-service
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: whisperx-asr-api
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    environment:
      - DEVICE=cuda
      - COMPUTE_TYPE=float16
      - BATCH_SIZE=16
      - HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
      - TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=true  # Required for PyTorch 2.6+
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities: [gpu]
    volumes:
      - whisperx-cache:/.cache
    networks:
      - speakr-network

  app:
    image: learnedmachine/speakr:latest
    container_name: speakr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8899:8899"
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/data/uploads
      - ./instance:/data/instance
    depends_on:
      - whisperx-asr
    networks:
      - speakr-network

networks:
  speakr-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  whisperx-cache:
    driver: local
```

In Speakr's `.env` file:
```bash
ASR_BASE_URL=http://whisperx-asr:9000
```

> **Note for Mac users:** GPU passthrough doesn't work on macOS due to Docker's architecture. Use CPU mode by setting `DEVICE=cpu` and `COMPUTE_TYPE=float32` in the environment variables. The ASR service will use CPU processing, which is slower but fully functional.

**Important:** When running both services in the same Docker Compose file, use the service name (e.g., `whisperx-asr` or `whisper-asr`) in `ASR_BASE_URL`, not `localhost` or an IP address.

#### Running Services in Separate Docker Compose Files

If you prefer to manage the services independently or are adding the ASR service to an existing Speakr installation, you can run them in separate Docker Compose files. This approach gives you more flexibility and works whether the services are on the same machine or different machines.

##### Option 1: Same Machine with Shared Network

If both services run on the same machine, you can use Docker's internal networking for communication:

First, create a shared Docker network:

```bash
docker network create speakr-network
```

Create `docker-compose.asr.yml` for the ASR service:

```yaml
services:
  whisper-asr:
    image: onerahmet/openai-whisper-asr-webservice:latest-gpu
    container_name: whisper-asr-webservice
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    environment:
      - ASR_MODEL=distil-large-v3
      - ASR_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8
      - ASR_ENGINE=whisperx
      - HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
      - TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=true  # Required for PyTorch 2.6+
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              capabilities: [gpu]
              device_ids: ["0"]
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - speakr-network

networks:
  speakr-network:
    external: true
```

Update your Speakr `docker-compose.yml` to use the shared network:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: learnedmachine/speakr:latest
    container_name: speakr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8899:8899"
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/data/uploads
      - ./instance:/data/instance
    networks:
      - speakr-network

networks:
  speakr-network:
    external: true
```

In your `.env` file, use the container name:
```bash
ASR_BASE_URL=http://whisper-asr-webservice:9000
```

##### Option 2: Separate Machines

When running on different machines, you don't need the shared network. Each service runs independently and communicates over the network using IP addresses or hostnames.

On the ASR server, create `docker-compose.asr.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  whisper-asr:
    image: onerahmet/openai-whisper-asr-webservice:latest-gpu
    container_name: whisper-asr-webservice
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"  # Exposed to the network
    environment:
      - ASR_MODEL=distil-large-v3
      - ASR_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8
      - ASR_ENGINE=whisperx
      - HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
      - TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=true  # Required for PyTorch 2.6+
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              capabilities: [gpu]
              device_ids: ["0"]
    restart: unless-stopped
```

On the Speakr server, use the standard `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: learnedmachine/speakr:latest
    container_name: speakr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8899:8899"
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/data/uploads
      - ./instance:/data/instance
```

In your Speakr `.env` file, use the ASR server's IP address or hostname:
```bash
# Using IP address
ASR_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.100:9000

# Or using hostname
ASR_BASE_URL=http://asr-server.local:9000
```

Start both services on their respective machines:

```bash
# On ASR server
docker compose -f docker-compose.asr.yml up -d

# On Speakr server
docker compose up -d
```

Make sure port 9000 is accessible between the machines (check firewall rules if needed).

## Production Considerations

### Using a Reverse Proxy for SSL

For production deployments, running Speakr behind a reverse proxy is essential for security and enabling all features. The browser recording feature, particularly system audio capture, requires HTTPS to work due to browser security restrictions. A reverse proxy handles SSL termination, meaning it manages the HTTPS certificates while communicating with Speakr over HTTP internally.

Here's a complete nginx configuration for Speakr:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name speakr.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;

    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8899;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        
        # WebSocket support for live features
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        
        # Timeouts for large file uploads
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
        proxy_send_timeout 300s;
    }
}

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name speakr.yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

The WebSocket configuration is important for real-time features in Speakr. The timeout settings ensure large file uploads don't get interrupted. You can obtain free SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt using Certbot, making HTTPS accessible for everyone.

If you prefer Apache, here's an equivalent configuration:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName speakr.yourdomain.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/certificate.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/private.key

    # Security Headers
    Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
    Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"

    # Proxy settings
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyRequests Off

    # Handle WebSockets for real-time features
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
    RewriteRule ^/?(.*) "ws://localhost:8899/$1" [P,L]

    <Location />
        ProxyPass http://localhost:8899/
        ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8899/
        RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Proto" expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}
    </Location>

    # Timeout for large uploads
    ProxyTimeout 300
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName speakr.yourdomain.com

    # Redirect to HTTPS
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]
</VirtualHost>
```

Apache requires these modules: `sudo a2enmod ssl proxy proxy_http proxy_wstunnel rewrite headers`

### Backup Strategy

Regular backups are essential for production deployments. Your Speakr data consists of three critical components that need backing up: the SQLite database in the `instance` directory, the audio files and transcriptions in the `uploads` directory, and your configuration in the `.env` file.

Create a backup script that captures all three components:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/speakr"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Create the backup
tar czf "$BACKUP_DIR/speakr_backup_$DATE.tar.gz" \
    /opt/speakr/instance \
    /opt/speakr/uploads \
    /opt/speakr/.env

# Optional: Keep only last 30 days of backups
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "speakr_backup_*.tar.gz" -mtime +30 -delete

echo "Backup completed: speakr_backup_$DATE.tar.gz"
```

Make the script executable and schedule it with cron for automated daily backups:

```bash
chmod +x /opt/speakr/backup.sh
crontab -e
# Add this line for daily backups at 2 AM:
0 2 * * * /opt/speakr/backup.sh
```

For critical deployments, consider copying backups to remote storage or cloud services for additional redundancy. The compressed backup size is typically much smaller than the original data, as audio files compress well.

### Monitoring and Maintenance

Proactive monitoring helps prevent issues before they impact users. Audio files can consume significant storage over time, especially if you're recording long meetings regularly. Set up disk space monitoring with alerts when usage exceeds 80%. A simple monitoring approach uses cron with df:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
USAGE=$(df /opt/speakr | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
if [ $USAGE -gt 80 ]; then
    echo "Warning: Speakr disk usage is at ${USAGE}%" | mail -s "Speakr Disk Alert" admin@example.com
fi
```

Monitor the Docker container health and logs regularly. You can use Docker's built-in health check feature or external monitoring tools. Check for patterns like repeated API failures, authentication errors, or processing timeouts. Also track your API usage and costs with your transcription service provider, as costs can add up with heavy usage.

### Security Hardening

Production deployments require additional security measures beyond the default configuration. Start by ensuring strong passwords for all accounts, especially the admin account. Never use default or simple passwords in production.

Restrict network access using firewall rules. If Speakr is only used internally, limit access to your organization's IP ranges:

```bash
# Example using ufw
ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 8899
ufw deny 8899
```

Implement rate limiting at the reverse proxy level to prevent abuse and API exhaustion. In nginx, you can add:

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=speakr:10m rate=10r/s;
limit_req zone=speakr burst=20;
```

Keep the Docker image updated with the latest security patches. Check for updates regularly and plan maintenance windows for updates. Always backup before updating, and test updates in a staging environment first if possible.

## Updating Speakr

Keeping Speakr updated ensures you have the latest features and security patches. The update process is straightforward but should be done carefully to avoid data loss.

First, always create a backup before updating:

```bash
# Create a backup
tar czf speakr_backup_before_update.tar.gz uploads/ instance/ .env

# Pull the latest image
docker compose pull

# Stop the current container
docker compose down

# Start with the new image
docker compose up -d

# Check the logs to ensure successful startup
docker compose logs -f app
```

The update process preserves all your data since it's stored in mounted volumes outside the container. However, checking the release notes is important as some updates might require configuration changes or have breaking changes that need attention.

If an update causes issues, you can rollback by specifying the previous version in your docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
image: learnedmachine/speakr:v1.2.3  # Replace with your previous version
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Container Won't Start

When the container fails to start, the logs usually tell you exactly what's wrong. Check them first:

```bash
docker compose logs app
```

Common startup issues include missing or malformed `.env` files. Ensure your `.env` file exists and has proper syntax. Each line should be `KEY=value` with no spaces around the equals sign. Comments start with `#`.

Port conflicts are another common issue. Check if port 8899 is already in use:

```bash
netstat -tulpn | grep 8899
# Or on macOS:
lsof -i :8899
```

If the port is in use, either stop the conflicting service or change Speakr's port in docker-compose.yml.

### Transcription Failures

Transcription failures usually stem from API configuration issues. Check the Docker logs for specific error messages:

```bash
docker compose logs app | grep -i error
```

Common transcription issues include incorrect API keys, which show as authentication errors in the logs. Double-check your keys in the `.env` file and ensure they're for the correct service. Insufficient API credits will show as quota or payment errors. Check your account balance with your API provider. Network connectivity issues appear as connection timeouts or DNS resolution failures.

For ASR endpoints, verify the service is running and accessible:

```bash
# Test ASR endpoint connectivity
curl http://your-asr-service:9000/docs
```

If using Docker networking with service names, remember that containers must be on the same network to communicate.

### Performance Issues

Slow performance can have multiple causes. Start by checking system resources:

```bash
# Check memory usage
free -h

# Check disk I/O
iotop

# Check Docker resource usage
docker stats speakr
```

If memory is constrained, consider adding swap space or upgrading your server. For disk I/O issues, ensure you're using SSD storage for the uploads and instance directories. Traditional hard drives can significantly slow down operations, especially with multiple concurrent users.

For large file processing, ensure chunking is properly configured. Without chunking, large files might timeout or fail completely. The chunk size should be slightly below your API's limit to account for encoding overhead.

If you're seeing slow transcription with many concurrent users, you might be hitting API rate limits. Check your API provider's documentation for rate limits and consider upgrading your plan if needed.

### Browser Recording Issues

If browser recording isn't working, especially system audio, the most common cause is using HTTP instead of HTTPS. Browsers require secure connections for audio capture due to privacy concerns. Either set up SSL with a reverse proxy or, for local development only, modify your browser's security settings to treat your local URL as secure.

In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://flags`, search for "insecure origins", and add your URL to the list. Remember this reduces security and should only be used for development.

## Building from Source

If you need to modify Speakr's code or prefer building your own images, you can build from source. This requires cloning the repository and using Docker's build capability.

First, clone the repository and navigate to it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr.git
cd speakr
```

Modify the docker-compose.yml to build locally instead of using the pre-built image:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        LIGHTWEIGHT: 0  # Set to 1 for a smaller image without PyTorch
    image: speakr:custom  # Tag for your custom build
    container_name: speakr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8899:8899"
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/data/uploads
      - ./instance:/data/instance
```

Build and start your custom version:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

To build a lightweight image without PyTorch directly:

```bash
docker build --build-arg LIGHTWEIGHT=1 -t speakr:lite .
```

The `--build` flag forces Docker to rebuild the image even if one exists. This is useful when you've made code changes and want to test them.

## Performance Optimization

For high-volume deployments or when processing many large files, optimization becomes important. Start with model selection if using ASR. For English-only content, the `distil-large-v3` model offers an excellent balance of speed and accuracy. For multilingual content, use `large-v3-turbo` which performs well across languages while being faster and using less memory than the full `large-v3` model.

Optimize Docker resource allocation for your workload:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: learnedmachine/speakr:latest
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 8G
          cpus: '4'
        reservations:
          memory: 4G
          cpus: '2'
```

This ensures Speakr has enough resources while preventing it from consuming everything on shared servers.

For storage performance, use SSD drives for the Docker volumes. The database benefits significantly from fast random I/O, and large audio file processing is much faster with SSDs. If using network storage, ensure low latency connections.
